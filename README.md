# Chatbot-Development-with-Java-MySQL-and-API-Integration
This project is a **Java-based chatbot** with a **Swing UI** and **MySQL database** for user registration and conversation tracking. It integrates with an **external API** to provide dynamic responses and securely stores conversation history. The tech stack includes **Java** for logic and UI, **MySQL** for data storage, **OkHttp** for API integration, and the **Gemini API** for response generation.

Key features include **email and username-based user registration**, **real-time API-driven responses**, and secure **conversation storage** using prepared statements. The **Swing UI** provides simple login and chat interfaces. Planned enhancements include **multi-language support**, **personalization**, and **analytics**.

The **Users** table stores the User ID, Name, Email, and Creation Date, while the **Conversation_History** table holds the Conversation ID, User ID, Message, Sender, and Timestamp.

To run the project, **clone the repository**, **set up MySQL** with the provided schema, and **add API keys** to the configuration files. Include dependencies like **JDBC drivers** and **OkHttp** for smooth connections. Finally, **run the project** using a Java IDE like **IntelliJ** or **Eclipse**.
